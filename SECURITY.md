## Reporting a vulnerability

We take all security bugs seriously.
Thank you for improving the security. We appreciate your efforts and
responsible disclosure and will make every effort to acknowledge your
contributions.

Report security bugs by emailing the maintainers at idziejczak3@gmail.com or kaszotto.gryczanotto@gmail.com.

The maintainers will acknowledge your email within 7 days, and will send a
more detailed response within 7 days indicating the next steps in handling
your report. After the initial reply to your report, we will
endeavor to keep you informed of the progress towards a fix and full
announcement, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining
the module.

## Disclosure Policy

When maintainers receive a security bug report, maintainers will assign it to a
primary handler. Maintainsers will coordinate the fix and release process,
involving the following steps:

  * Confirm the problem.
  * Audit code to find any potential similar problems.
  * Prepare fixes. These fixes will be
    released as fast as possible.

## Comments on this Policy

If you have suggestions on how this process could be improved please submit a
pull request.
