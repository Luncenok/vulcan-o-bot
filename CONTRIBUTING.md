# Contributing to Transcriptase

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We Develop with Github

We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we
use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `develop`.
4. Ensure the bot builds.
5. Make sure your code works.
6. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the
same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the
maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/Luncenok/vulcan-o-bot/issues)

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug
by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/Luncenok/vulcan-o-bot/issues/new); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail

**Good Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What should happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening)

## License
